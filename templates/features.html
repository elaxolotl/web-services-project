    <h2>Streamlined Auction Management with Automated Winner Assignment</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
        Gavel API includes a daily task that automatically assigns auction winners, ensuring fairness and efficiency.
        Every 24 hours, the task checks for auctions that have reached their due date. If an auction has ended, the
        system automatically assigns the winner by selecting the highest bid. This feature eliminates manual
        intervention and ensures timely resolutions.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
        For example, when an auction is created with a due date 24 hours in the future, the task runs at the scheduled
        time, verifies the due date, and assigns the winner to the highest bidder. This process helps maintain fairness
        and keeps operations running smoothly.

    <h2>Priority Handling of Perishable Goods</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
        Our system ensures efficient management of detained goods by prioritizing perishable items during searches. When
        you search for detained goods, the system first displays perishable goods that are closest to their expiration
        date. This feature helps prevent spoilage and ensures timely processing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
        Non-perishable goods are displayed next, ordered by the date they were added to the system. This logical
        prioritization helps customs officers efficiently handle goods based on urgency, reducing waste and improving
        operational flow.
